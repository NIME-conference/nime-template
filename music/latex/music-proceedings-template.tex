% The "title" command has an optional parameter,
% allowing the author to define a "short title" to be used in page headers.
\title{Title: Your NIME Music Performance}



% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define
% the authors and their affiliations.
% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the
% "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
% used to denote shared contribution to the research.
\author{Author \#1}
\affiliation{%
  \institution{Affilitation \#1}

% By default, the full list of authors will be used in the page
% headers. Often, this list is too long, and will overlap
% other information printed in the page headers. This command allows
% the author to define a more concise list
% of authors' names for this purpose.
\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{Trovato and Tobin, et al.}


% Keywords. The author(s) should pick words that accurately describe
% the work being presented. Separate the keywords with commas.
\keywords{datasets, neural networks, gaze detection, text tagging}


% This command processes the author and affiliation and title
% information and builds the first part of the formatted document.
